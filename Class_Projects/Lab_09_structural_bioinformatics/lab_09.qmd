## The RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

Download a CSV file from the PDB site **(accessible from "Analyze" \> "PDB Statistics" \> "by Experimental Method and Molecular Type"**. Move this CSV file into your RStudio project and use it to answer the following questions:
```{r}
PDB_stat <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
PDB_stat

n_xray <- sum(strtoi(gsub(",", "", PDB_stat$X.ray)))
n_xray

n_total <- sum(strtoi(gsub(",", "", PDB_stat$Total)))
n_total

n_xray/n_total

n_protein <- PDB_stat$Total[1]
n_protein <- strtoi(gsub(",", "",n_protein))
n_protein/n_total
```

# Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.
A: > n_xray/n_total
   [1] 0.8628665

# Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?
A: > n_protein/n_total
   [1] 0.8701183
   
# Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
A: 272

# Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

A: water molecules contain three atoms: one oxygen and two hydrogens. The hydrogen atom is the first on the periodic table and has the smallest size. With the resolution applied for the purpose of crystalography, hydrogen molecule could not be detected.

# Q5: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

A: The water molecule is found between the ligand and the isoleucine on residue 50.

# Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain (we recommend "Ball & Stick" for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

Discussion Topic: Can you think of a way in which indinavir, or even larger ligands and substrates, could enter the binding site?

Q7: \[Optional\] As you have hopefully observed HIV protease is a homodimer (i.e. it is composed of two identical chains). With the aid of the graphic display can you identify secondary structure elements that are likely to only form in the dimer rather than the monomer?

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdf
```

The ATOM records of a PDF file are stored in 'pdf\$atom'

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)

```

# Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

A: 198

# Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?

A: MK1

# Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

A: 2

# Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN?

A: MSA

# Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?:

A: bio3d-view

# Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket?

A: TRUE

Use these ADK structures for analysis

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa

#b <- blast.pdb(aa)

hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')

# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

# Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence?

A: 214

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

```{r}
# Vector containing PDB codes for figure axis
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)

# Draw schematic alignment
#plot(pdbs, labels=ids)
#figure margin too large, cause issues during rendering
```

```{r}
anno <- pdb.annotate(ids)
unique(anno$source)
```

1.  get.seq()
2.  blast.pbd()
3.  get.pdb(hits\$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
4.  pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
# Calculate RMSD
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)

# Structure-based clustering
hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
```

```{r}
#Plotting results with ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)

df <- data.frame(PC1=pc.xray$z[,1], 
                 PC2=pc.xray$z[,2], 
                 col=as.factor(grps.rd),
                 ids=ids)

p <- ggplot(df) + 
  aes(PC1, PC2, col=col, label=ids) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 20) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
p
```

```{r}
# NMA of all structures
modes <- nma(pdbs)
plot(modes, pdbs, col=grps.rd)
```

# Q14. What do you note about this plot? Are the black and colored lines similar or different? Where do you think they differ most and why?

A: The black and colored lines are different and can be distinguished into two major categories. The difference is reflected in the proteins' flexibility and essentially suggests that there are more than one conformational states for the given protein.

```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```
